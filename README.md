# RoadSense-AI-Hazard-Detection

This project is a development-oriented project that integrates computer vision, machine learning, mobile data capture, and interactive map visualization. It applies an object-detection model (YOLOv8) to analyze road footage and automatically identify potholes linked to their geographic location. The system stores, processes, and displays these detections on a shared mapping platform. The project combines research activities (dataset analysis and model training) with engineering tasks (frontend, backend, and map integration).
